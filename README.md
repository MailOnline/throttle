# throttle

A request throttling library for Clojure. It comes equipped with http get request throttling out of the box, which is one important use case. If you need generic function throttling (and then the http-kit plumbing and thread-pool definition is up to you) please see https://github.com/brunoV/throttler

## how to use

Add:

        [throttle "0.1.0"]

to your project.clj. Or:

        (require '[throttle.http :as http])

at the REPL. Here's an example snippet:

```clojure
    (ns test
      (:require [throttle.http :as http]))

    (def fb "https://api.facebook.com/method/links.getStats?format=json&urls=")

    ;; You want to know how much buzz these news are generating on facebook
    ;; say you have 10k of these urls:
    (def urls [
     (str fb "http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/orion-spaceship-looks-good-during-first-test-road-mars-n262146")
     (str fb "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/12/05/president-obama-picks-former-pentagon-official-ashton-carter-to-be-defense/")
     (str fb "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/business/economy/november-jobs-unemployment-figures.html")])

  ; will retrieve them with max 10 concurrent connections at the total of 2 req/second
  (def res (http/get urls))

  ; will retrieve them with max 10 concurrent connections at the total of 20 req/second
  (def res (http/get urls 20))

  ; will retrieve them with max 20 concurrent connections at the total of 5 req/second
  (def res (http/get urls 5 20))

  ; the response is going to be the same map of keys http-kit returns plus the elapsed
  (map #(-> [(:elapsed %) (last (re-find #"share_count\":(\d+)" (:body %)))]) res)

  ; that returns something like ([1273 "85"] [88 "245"] [112 "208"]) where the first
  ; number is the elapsed and the second are the share counts.

```

Invoking http/throttle will return a map of all the keys returned by http-kit with the additional
elasped added by throttle itself.

## TODO

* other kind of throttling for services not necesarily on HTTP, like native ElasticSearch
